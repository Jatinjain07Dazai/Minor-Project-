Jack Sparoow is a fun movie i really liked that movie. But I have to write a Thesis on it which seems super boring.
Wait I have an idea , i should write some lines of start and some of end and just extract all the text from the

He can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than by force,

Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Hector Barbossa.

In later adventures he searches for the Fountain of Youth and the Trident of Poseidon.

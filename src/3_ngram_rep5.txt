A firewall is software or hardware that stops suspicious traffic from entering or leaving a network while letting legitimate traffic through. Firewalls can be deployed at the edges of a network or used internally to divide a larger network into smaller subnetworks. If one part of the network is compromised, hackers are still shut off from the rest.

There are different types of firewalls with different features. Basic firewalls use packet filtering to inspect traffic. More advanced next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) add intrusion prevention, AI and machine learning, application awareness and control, and threat intelligence feeds for extra protection.

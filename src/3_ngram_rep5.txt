Traditional network security systems focused on keeping threats from breaching the network's perimeter. Once a user got in, they were treated as trustworthy and granted practically unrestricted access.

Perimeter-based security controls are less effective in distributed networks, so many IT security teams are shifting to zero-trust network security frameworks. Instead of focusing on the perimeter, zero-trust network security places security controls around individual resources. Users are never implicitly trusted. Every time a user tries to access a resource, they must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of whether they're already on the company network. Authenticated users are only granted least-privilege access, and their permissions are revoked as soon as their task is done.
